\section{Conclusion}
%summary
In this demonstration, we showcase an interactive route analyser which helps the interaction between users and route recommendation systems. 
The system benefits from the explicit feature construction of the structured prediction model and visualises recommended routes along with relevant information on both route and POI level.
As future work, it is of interest to incorporate in the structured prediction model the amount of time tourists spent at each POI, 
and recommend the visit duration at POIs with proper visualisation as well.
