\section{Conclusion}
%summary
In this demonstration, we detail an interactive route analyser which helps the interaction between users and route recommendation systems. 
The system benefits from the explicit feature construction of the structured prediction model, and visualises recommended routes in terms of information on both the routes and POIs.
%As future work, it is of interest to incorporate %in the structured prediction model 
%the amount of time tourists spent at each POI, 
%and recommend the visit duration at POIs with proper visualisation as well.
